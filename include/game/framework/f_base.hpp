/**
 * @brief The base class for all scenes, actors and various other processes.
 * @ingroup framework
 * @details
 * ## Overview
 * fBase_c defines the core elements of a process, to provide common behaviour across all bases.
 *
 * The most significant components are:
 * - ::mUniqueID, a unique identifier for every created base.
 * - ::mParam, a 32-bit value used to configure the base. For profiles representing level sprites, this
 * field is equivalent to nybbles 5 to 12 of Reggie' sprite data. Classes that don't represent a specific
 * profile should avoid using this value to determine their behaviour.
 * - ::mProfName, an identifier for the base's profile.
 * - ::mGroupType, which specifies the base's group type (see
 * [Inheritance and Group Types](#inheritance-and-group-types) for more details).
 * - The class embeds @ref ::mMng "an instance of fManager_c", which manages most of the base's lifecycle.
 * - The remaining fields are also related to the base's lifecycle or are entirely unused.
 *
 * ## Creating Bases
 * A base can be created by calling the ::createRoot or the ::createChild functions. Most subclasses
 * provide their own implementations of these functions with additional parameters available; their use
 * is recommended.
 *
 * The overloaded @ref ::operator new() "new" operator ensures that bases are zero-initialized (therefore
 * initializing fields to zero is not necessary), while the @ref ::operator delete "delete" operator is
 * provided for convenience.
 *
 * ## Deleting Bases
 * Bases can be deleted by calling ::deleteRequest on them. A base will be informed of its impending
 * deletion when its ::deleteReady method is called. Please note that deleting a base will delete all
 * its children as well.
 *
 * ## Iterating Bases
 * A small iteration API is provided:
 * - Use ::getConnectParent to get a base's parent.
 * - Use ::getConnectChild to get a base's first child.
 * - Use ::getConnectBrNext to get a base's next sibling.
 *
 * For conducting searches across the entire base tree, please refer to
 * @xlink{./classfManager__c.html#global-base-searching, fManager_c}.
 *
 * ## Inheritance and Group Types
 * The ::mGroupType field offers basic type information about a base:
 * - Bases with group type ::OTHER are generic processes, which inherit from dBase_c.
 * - Bases with group type ::SCENE are scene profiles, which inherit from dScene_c.
 * - Bases with group type ::ACTOR are game entities, which inherit from dBaseActor_c.
 *
 * No base inherits fBase_c directly.
 *
 * ## Base Lifecycle
 * The lifecycle of a base consists of multiple operations, whose behaviour can be overridden by any of the
 * subclasses. Each operation has an @xlink{./classfManager__c.html#implementation, associated linked list},
 * containing all bases for which said operation is scheduled for the current frame. fBase_c (and
 * fManager_c) manage operation scheduling internally, therefore developer interaction is not required.
 *
 * ### Operation Flow
 * Every operation is composed by three steps: @p pre , @p do and @p post (each with their own methods).
 * While the @p do method is generally reserved for profile-specific behaviour, the @p pre and @p post
 * methods are commonly used to supply shared behaviour in base classes.
 *
 * The @p pre and @p do steps return a ::PACK_RESULT_e value, which is converted to a ::MAIN_STATE_e
 * value to determine the result of the operation. Said value is then passed to the @p post method,
 * which acts accordingly.
 * @p pre step result | @p do step result | @p post argument
 * :-----------------: | :----------------: | :--------------:
 * ::NOT_READY | *N/A (not run)* | ::CANCELED
 * ::SUCCEEDED | ::NOT_READY | ::WAITING
 * ::SUCCEEDED | ::SUCCEEDED | ::SUCCESS
 * ::SUCCEEDED | ::FAILED | ::ERROR
 * Operations are carried out by the ::commonPack function.
 *
 * ### Core Operations
 * fBase_c defines four core operations:
 * - @p create runs immediately after construction, and can be used to set up the base or load resources
 * for it. The operation result leads to three possible outcomes:
 *  - If the operation result is ::SUCCESS, the base enters the main execution cycle.
 *  - If the operation result is ::CANCELED or ::WAITING, the operation will be reattempted in the next frame.
 *  - If the operation result is ::ERROR, the base is deleted.
 *
 * - @p execute serves as the base's own main loop, running every frame. This operation can be skipped by
 * enabling the relevant ::PROC_DISABLE_e flag.
 * - @p draw offers an alternative main loop specifically for rendering code. It also runs every frame,
 * and can be skipped by enabling the relevant ::PROC_DISABLE_e flag.
 * - @p delete runs immediately before destruction, and can be used to deallocate resources or remove
 * links to other bases. This operation will not proceed until all the base's children are deleted.
 *
 * @inlineimage dol/framework/fBase_lifecycle.svg
 * @imagecaption{The lifecycle of a base.}
 *
 * ### Connect Operation
 * @p connect is an internal operation for process management that runs every frame along the
 * aforementioned four; bases should not override it. See ::connectProc for more information on the tasks
 * carried out in this operation.
 *
 * ## Unused Content
 * - ::sLoadAsyncCallback and ::sUnloadCallback are presumably related to the scrapped relocatable
 * profile system (more details here). These callbacks are set to empty placeholder functions (which belong
 * to dBase_c) by dBase_c::initLoader. Judging by their names, they were supposed to be called after a
 * profile module would have been loaded/unloaded.
 * - Each base supports having its own @ref ::mHeap "heap". The heap name, translated from Japanese,
 * is *Heap that each process can have individually (fBase_c::mHeap)*. Two working methods for creating
 * this heap are still in the game (::entryFrmHeap, ::entryFrmHeapNonAdjust), but are unused. This per-base
 * allocation method was most likely discontinued in favour of mAllocator_c and its derivatives.
 * - Two additional unused list-like structures are present in the class: ::mpUnusedHelper and
 * ::mUnusedList. Since the symbols for the related functions have not yet been cracked, it's difficult
 * to tell what their purpose might have been.
 *
 * @todo Link to unused relocation system article and mAllocator_c when their page gets written.
